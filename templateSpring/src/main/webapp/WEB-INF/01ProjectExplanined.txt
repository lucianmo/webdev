All Spring config files (including Spring MVC ones) are inside src/main/resource.
There are mostly 2 reasons to that:
- All Spring config files are grouped into one single place
- It is simpler to reference them from inside JUnit tests

The Spring Container, "root" context is in "classpath*:META-INF/spring/applicationContext-bootstrap.xml". 
It allows you to configure your beans, or to indicate the context of your application. 
This is the place where you define your business logic beans, resources, and all other beans that are not directly 
related to the web tier.
This bootstrap file should use the <import resource=""/> to include other config files.

DispatcherServlet then loads the servlet configuration into a separate context, with the root context as its parent.
Is finded in /WEB-INF/spring/webmvc-config.xml.
