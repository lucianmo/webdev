All Spring config files (including Spring MVC ones) are inside src/main/resource.
There are mostly 2 reasons to that:
- All Spring config files are grouped into one single place
- It is simpler to reference them from inside JUnit tests

The Spring Container, "root" context is in "classpath*:META-INF/spring/applicationContext-bootstrap.xml"
This bootstrap file should use the <import resource=""/> to include other config files.

DispatcherServlet then loads the servlet configuration into a separate context, with the root context as its parent.
Is finded in /WEB-INF/spring/webmvc-config.xml.
